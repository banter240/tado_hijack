Tado restricted their API? They think you shouldn't control your own heating? **Tado Hijack begs to differ.**

I engineered this integration with one goal: **To squeeze every drop of functionality out of Tado's cloud without triggering their rate limits.** We bridge the gap between Tado's restricted API and your smart home, unlocking features that Tado keeps hidden, all while treating every single API call like gold.

<br>

> [!WARNING]
> **Compatibility Note (Tado X / Matter):**
> This integration is currently optimized for **Tado V3+** (IB01) systems.
> **Tado X** devices use the new Matter architecture and a different API which is **not yet supported**. Support is planned for a future release; current focus is on perfecting the V3+ and HomeKit experience.

## 🏴‍☠️ The Hijack Philosophy

Tado's restricted REST API often forces a trade-off between frequent updates and staying within daily rate limits. **Tado Hijack takes a different path.** 

Instead of just "polling less," we use **Deep Command Merging** and **HomeKit Injection** to make every single API call count. We don't replace your local HomeKit setup; we "hijack" it, injecting missing cloud power-features directly into the existing devices.

*   **💎 Zero Waste:** 10 commands across 10 rooms? Still only **1 API call**.
*   **🔗 No Redundancy:** HomeKit handles local climate; we handle the cloud secrets.
*   **📡 Transparency:** Real-time quota tracking directly from Tado's response headers.

### ⚖️ The "Why" Factor

**Tado has gone full "Pay-to-Win".** 

They've crippled the standard API to a pathetic **100 calls per day**, effectively taking your smart home hostage unless you pay for a subscription. We are currently in the transition phase where the original 5,000 calls are being steadily choked down to 100—a textbook example of **artificial scarcity**.

Tado Hijack is the definitive technical response to this hostility. I've engineered the **Auto API Quota** system specifically to handle this shrinking window, intelligently distributing your remaining "Gold" to ensure you never lose control.

*   **🛡️ Fighting Artificial Scarcity:** While Tado tries to force you into a subscription "toll booth," our **Deep Command Batching** and **Auto Quota** ensure you stay in total control, even as your limits vanish.
*   **⚡ Supercharged Resistance:** We stand on the shoulders of the Open Source community. Tado Hijack uses patched, high-efficiency libraries to maximize every single interaction.
*   **⚖️ Reclaim Your Hardware:** We refuse to play the subscription game. We squeeze maximum functionality out of the "Standard" tier, proving that superior engineering beats predatory throttling.
*   **📡 Quota Transparency:** Monitor your remaining "API Gold" in real-time. Know exactly when they try to silence your devices and stay one step ahead.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

<br>

### 🧠 Extreme Batching Technology
While other integrations waste your precious API quota for every tiny interaction, Tado Hijack features **Deep Command Merging**. We collect multiple actions and fuse them into a single, highly efficient bulk request.

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Maximum Fusion Scenario:**
> Triggering a "Party Scene": **AC Living Room** (Temp + Fan + Swing) + **AC Kitchen** (Temp + Fan) + **Hot Water** (ON).
>
> ❌ **Standard Integrations:** 6-8 API calls (Half your hourly quota gone).
> ✅ **Tado Hijack:** **1 single API call** for everything.
>
> *Note: This works within your configurable **Debounce Window**. Every action is automatically fused.*

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Universal Batching:** This applies to manual dashboard interactions AND automated service calls (like `set_timer`). 10 timers at once? **Still only 1 API call.**

<br>

---

### 🤝 The HomeKit "Missing Link"
**We don't replace HomeKit. We fix it.** 
Almost no other integration does this: Tado Hijack automatically detects your existing HomeKit devices and **injects** the missing cloud-only power-features directly into them. You get the rock-solid local control of HomeKit combined with advanced cloud features in **one single unified device**.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Hybrid Architecture:**
> This integration is designed to work **alongside** the native HomeKit Device integration.
> *   **HomeKit:** Provides the `climate` entity (Local Temperature Control & Current Temp).
> *   **Tado Hijack:** Provides the "Missing Links" (Schedules, Hot Water, AC Modes, Hardware Settings).
>
> *Note: Without HomeKit, regular heating valves will NOT have a climate entity.*

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **No Redundancy:** Tado Hijack does **not** provide temperature control for regular heating valves (TRVs), as HomeKit already handles this perfectly. We focus strictly on the features HomeKit cannot see: **Cloud-only controls** and logical Zone Schedules.

<br>

---

### 🛠️ Unleashed Features (Non-HomeKit)
We bring back the controls Tado "forgot" to give you:

*   **🚿 Hot Water & AC Unleashed:** Full temperature and power control for boilers and AC units.
*   **❄️ AC Pro Features:** Precise Fan Speed and Swing (Horizontal/Vertical) selection.
*   **🔥 Valve Opening Insight:** View the percentage of how far your valves are open (updated during state polls).
*   **🔋 Real Battery Status:** Don't guess; see the actual health of every valve.
*   **🌡️ Temperature Offset:** Interactive calibration for your thermostats.
*   **✨ Dazzle Mode:** Control the display behavior of your V3+ hardware.
*   **🏠 Presence Lock:** Force Home/Away modes regardless of what Tado thinks.
*   **🔓 Rate Limit Bypass:** Experimental support for local [tado-api-proxy](https://github.com/s1adem4n/tado-api-proxy) to bypass daily limits.

## 📊 API Consumption Strategy

<br>

Tado's API limits are restrictive. That's why Tado Hijack uses a **Zero-Waste Policy**:

### API Consumption Table

<br>

| Action | Cost | Frequency | Description | Detailed API Calls |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Poll** | **2** | Configurable | State, HVAC, Valve %, Humidity. | `GET /homes/{id}/state`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/zoneStates` |
| **Battery Update** | **2** | 24h (Default) | Fetches device list & metadata. | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices` |
| **Refresh Zones** | **2** | On Demand | Updates zone/device metadata. | `GET /homes/{id}/zones`<br>`GET /homes/{id}/devices` |
| **Refresh Offsets** | **N** | On Demand | Fetches all device offsets. | `GET /devices/{s}/temperatureOffset` (×N) |
| **Refresh Away** | **M** | On Demand | Fetches all zone away temps. | `GET /zones/{z}/awayConfiguration` (×M) |
| **Zone Overlay** | **1** | On Demand | **Fused:** All zone changes in 1 call. | `POST /homes/{id}/overlay` |
| **Home/Away** | **1** | On Demand | Force presence lock. | `PUT /homes/{id}/presenceLock` |

<br>

> [!TIP]
> **Throttled Mode:** When API quota runs low, the integration can automatically disable periodic polling to preserve remaining quota for your automations.

<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Granular Refresh Strategy:** To keep your quota green, hardware configurations (Offsets, Away Temperatures) are **never** fetched automatically. They remain empty until you manually trigger a specific refresh button or set a value.

<br>

### 📈 Auto API Quota (The Brain)

Tado Hijack doesn't just guess. It uses a **Predictive Consumption Model** to distribute your API calls evenly throughout the day. 

*   **⚡ Real-Time Cost Measurement:** The system measures the *actual* cost of every polling cycle and uses a smoothed moving average to predict future consumption.
*   **🕒 Dynamic Reset-Sync:** It calculates the exact seconds remaining until the next API reset (**12:01 CET**) and adjusts your polling interval on-the-fly.
*   **📉 Hybrid Budget Strategy:** The system uses **two strategies** and picks the more generous one:
    *   **Long-term:** Distribute your daily target evenly across the day
    *   **Short-term:** Always keep polling with X% of currently remaining quota
    *   This ensures the system **never stops polling** when quota runs low, while still respecting your daily budget when possible.

<br>

**How your "API Gold" is managed:**

```
FREE_QUOTA = Daily_Limit - Throttle_Reserve - (Predicted_Daily_Maintenance_Cost)
TARGET_BUDGET = FREE_QUOTA * Auto_API_Quota_%
REMAINING_BUDGET = MAX(
    TARGET_BUDGET - Used_Today,           # Long-term: Daily plan
    (Remaining - Throttle_Reserve) * %    # Short-term: Always use X% of what's left
)
```

<br>

**Example Adaptive Logic:**
| Situation | Remaining Quota | Time to Reset | Resulting Interval |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Normal** | 3000 | 12h | **~45s** |
| **Heavy Usage** | 500 | 8h | **~180s** (Auto-Stretch) |
| **Emergency** | < Threshold | Any | **Throttled** (Polling Suspended) |

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> The internal math uses a 15-second safety floor and a 1-hour ceiling. The **hybrid strategy** ensures polling continues even when you've exceeded your daily budget—it will always use X% of remaining quota as a fallback. This prevents self-throttling when quota is low (e.g., 100 calls remaining).

<br>

### 🧠 Batching Capability Matrix

Not all API calls are created equal. Tado Hijack optimizes everything, but physics (and the Tado API) sets limits.

<br>

| Action Type | Examples | Strategy | API Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **State Control** | Target Temp, Turn Off All, Resume Schedule, Hot Water Power, AC Fan | **FUSED** | **1 Call Total** (regardless of zone count) |
| **Global Mode** | Home/Away Presence | **DIRECT** | **1 Call** |
| **Zone Config** | Early Start, Open Window, Dazzle Mode | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Zone** (Sequentially executed) |
| **Device Config** | Child Lock, Temperature Offset | **DEBOUNCED** | **1 Call per Device** (Sequentially executed) |

<br>

> **Fused (True Batching):**
> Multiple actions across multiple zones are merged into a **single** API request.
> *Example: Turning off 10 rooms at once = **1 API Call**.*
>
> **Debounced (Rapid Update Protection):**
> Prevents spamming the API while dragging sliders. Only the final value is sent.
> *Example: Dragging a slider from 18°C to 22°C generates 20 intermediate events, but only **1 API Call** is sent.*

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Why not batch everything?**
> Tado does **not** provide bulk API endpoints for device configurations (Child Lock, Offset, Window Detection). We must send these commands individually per device. We optimize what we can, but we cannot invent endpoints that don't exist.

<br>

## 🛠️ Architecture

<br>

### Physical Device Mapping
Unlike other integrations that group everything by "Zone", Tado Hijack maps entities to their **physical devices** (Valves/Thermostats).
*   **Matched via Serial Number:** Automatic injection into existing HomeKit devices.
*   **No HomeKit?** We create dedicated devices containing **only** the cloud features (Battery, Offset, Child Lock, etc.), but **no** temperature control.

<br>

### Robustness & Security
*   **Custom Client Layer:** I extend the underlying library via inheritance to handle API communication reliably and fix common deserialization errors.
*   **Privacy by Design:** All logs are automatically redacted. Sensitive data (User Codes, Serial Numbers, Home IDs) is stripped before writing to disk.

## ⚠️ Limitations

<br>

### API Constraints

These limitations are imposed by Tado's API design, not by this integration:

- **Device Configuration:** Child Lock, Temperature Offset, and Window Detection settings must be sent individually per device. Tado does not provide bulk endpoints for these operations.
- **Offset Polling Cost:** Reading temperature offsets costs **1 API call per device** with temperature capability. For large setups (10+ valves), consider disabling automatic offset polling (`offset_poll_interval: 0`) and using manual refresh buttons instead.
- **Rate Limits:** Tado enforces daily API quotas (100-500 calls depending on tier). The Auto API Quota feature manages this automatically, but heavy manual interaction can still exhaust your quota.

<br>

### Not Supported

- **Tado X Devices:** The new "Tado X" product line uses a different API (Matter/Thread-based). This integration only supports the classic Tado devices. For Tado X, use the official Home Assistant integration with Matter support.
- **Local Control:** Tado does not provide a local API. All commands must go through Tado's cloud servers.
- **Energy Dashboard:** While we provide `add_meter_reading` for Energy IQ tracking in the Tado app, this data is not exposed in a way that integrates with Home Assistant's native Energy Dashboard.

<br>
